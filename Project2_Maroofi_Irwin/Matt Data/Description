Units:  Index 1982-1984=100, Seasonally Adjusted
Frequency:  Monthly
The "Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items Less Food & Energy" is an aggregate of prices paid by urban consumers for a typical basket of goods, excluding food and energy. This measurement, known as "Core CPI," is widely used by economists because food and energy have very volatile prices. The Bureau of Labor Statistics defines and measures the official CPI, and more information can be found in the FAQ or in this article.

Units:  Percent of GDP, Seasonally Adjusted
Frequency:  Quarterly
Federal Debt: Total Public Debt as Percent of Gross Domestic Product (GFDEGDQ188S) was first constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in October 2012. It is calculated using Federal Government Debt: Total Public Debt (GFDEBTN) and Gross Domestic Product, 1 Decimal (GDP):
GFDEGDQ188S = ((GFDEBTN/1000)/GDP)*100
GFDEBTN/1000 transforms GFDEBTN from millions of dollars to billions of dollars.

Dates of U.S. recessions as inferred by GDP-based recession indicator (JHDUSRGDPBR)
Source: Hamilton, James  Release: GDP-Based Recession Indicator Index  
Units:  +1 or 0, Not Seasonally Adjusted
Frequency:  Quarterly
The series assigns dates to U.S. recessions based on a mathematical model of the way that recessions differ from expansions. Whereas the NBER business cycle dates are based on a subjective assessment of a variety of indicators, the dates here are entirely mechanical and are calculated solely from historically reported GDP data. Whenever the GDP-based recession indicator index rises above 67%, the economy is determined to be in a recession. The date that the recession is determined to have begun is the first quarter prior to that date for which the inference from the mathematical model using all data available at that date would have been above 50%. The next time the GDP-based recession indicator index falls below 33%, the recession is determined to be over, and the last quarter of the recession is the first quarter for which the inference from the mathematical model using all available data at that date would have been below 50%.
